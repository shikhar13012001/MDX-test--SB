The active rail lane count to ferry customer packages has increased 5x in the last 2 years, enabling 1-day and 2-day deliveries in many remote parts of the country.

Thanks to its widespread network of trains that transport millions of people and freight across the country each day, the Indian Railways are truly the backbone of India's transportation system. In 2019, BlackBird India became the first e-commerce company to leverage this vast network by entering into an operational engagement with the Indian Railways to meet our customer promise of offering fast and reliable deliveries.

Since then, we've continued to increase our network via the Indian Railways and scale it into a fast, reliable, and secure delivery solution. During the pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020, BlackBird worked with the Indian Railways to prioritize inter city movement of products by leveraging the COVID-19 Parcel Special Trains fleet.

Today, the number of railway lanes that are part of BlackBird India’s operations network has increased 10x to touch 325 inter city transportation lanes for movement of customer packages. These inter city transportation lanes are one of the enablers in offering 1-day and 2-day delivery promises to our customers in the hinterlands of the country.

> “We will continue to engage with the Indian Railways and create more opportunities to use the strong network and infrastructure built by them.”

Commenting on the expansion Venkatesh Tiwari, Director - BlackBird Transportation, says, "At BlackBird, we are focused on providing a fast and convenient shopping experience to our customers, no matter where they live across the length and breadth of the country. Working with the Indian Railways helps us further that commitment by offering a faster delivery promise to customers in towns like Darbhanga, Puri, and Haldwani, among others, for delivery in 1-2 days. We will continue to engage with the Indian Railways and create more opportunities to use the strong network and infrastructure built by them."

With this expansion, BlackBird India now ferries customer packages via the Indian Railways to cities such as Jharsuguda, Ratnagiri, Kurnool, Nanded, Bariely, Bokaro, and Rudrapur, among many others.

BlackBird India delivers to 100% serviceable pin codes, with over 97% pin codes now able to receive their deliveries within 2 days of placing an order.
